      <p>Hello! My name is up there in big letters. I'm a gal of many hats, some of which I've knit myself. I've been a web developer with a focus on UI/UX design and front-end coding for over a decade, and before that, I majored in English. In high school, I sang and played piano for the choir. I have since traded my piano keyboard for a computer keyboard, and while I miss making music, I much prefer making websites.</p>

      <p>Everything I know about web design and development was learned on the job and on the fly. I picked up HTML and CSS in college and learned bits of JavaScript as projects called for it. I spent ten years and a few summers working for a small, family-run web-consulting company called <a href="http://daodesign.com/" target="_blank">DaoDesign</a>. I could show you what we've done, but to do so would be in violation of several NDAs, so instead I'll tell you.</p>
